Classes and Ojects are the two main aspects of OOP.
Classes are blueprints for creating objects. They define the properties and behaviors of the objects.
When varibles are declared within a class they are called attributes
Classes can have functions or methods defined within them
 These methods can be used to manipulate the data within the class or perform actions related to the class.


 Definine a function outside the clas definition, you have to declare it inside
 the class, folloowed the schop resoltion :: operator and then the function name.

class Cat{
}
int Car::speed(int speed){
    return speed;
}
