// Notes on CONSTRUCTORS:
/*
a constructor is special C++ that is automatically called when an object of a class is created.
When creating a construnctor, the name of the constructor must be the same as the class name.
Constructors do not have a return type, not even void. They are used to initialize the object when it is created.
class MyClass{
    public:
        MyClass(){ // Constructor
            // Initialization code here
        }
};
A constructor is always public and it has no return type
They ca also take parameter, they are always.aligna*/
