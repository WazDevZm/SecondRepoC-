## Description

This repository contains C++ code samples and exercises focused on fundamental programming concepts. It includes implementations of data structures (such as doubly linked lists), sorting algorithms (like bubble sort), and other example programs. Each file is designed to help users learn and practice C++.

## About the Codebase

This repository is a comprehensive collection of C++ code samples, exercises, and mini-projects designed to help users learn, practice, and master core programming concepts. The codebase covers:

- **Fundamental Syntax & Control Flow**: Basic programs demonstrating variables, loops, conditionals, and functions.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Examples of classes, constructors, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **Data Structures**: Implementations of arrays, structures, singly and doubly linked lists, pointers, and vectors.
- **Algorithms**: Sorting algorithms (bubble sort, etc.), recursion, and other algorithmic techniques.
- **Practical Exercises & Exam Prep**: Solutions to sample problems, exam questions, and exercises for hands-on practice.
- **Miscellaneous Demos**: Small projects and code snippets for specific C++ features or real-world scenarios.

Each file is self-contained and includes comments to explain the logic. The repository is ideal for students, educators, and anyone looking to strengthen their C++ skills through practical examples.

## Contents

- **Linked Lists**: Examples of singly and doubly linked lists.
- **Sorting**: Implementations of sorting algorithms, including bubble sort.
- **Other Samples**: Additional C++ exercises and demonstrations.

## Usage

Open any `.cpp` file in your IDE (such as Visual Studio Code), build, and run to see the output and understand how each algorithm or data structure works.
